# ReactTodo
As part of the SoftUni React course, I had the opportunity to work on one of the initial projects. The task involved converting a provided html/css template and integrating it with a mock server to build a functional ToDo list application in React. The application needed to support dynamic retrieval of tasks, status change of tasks and the addition of new tasks.
